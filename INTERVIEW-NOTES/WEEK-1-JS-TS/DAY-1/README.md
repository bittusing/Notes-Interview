# WEEK 1 - DAY 1: JavaScript Runtime Fundamentals

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 1. Execution Context
- Global vs Function Execution Context
- Creation Phase vs Execution Phase
- Variable Environment and Lexical Environment
- Scope Chain mechanism
- `this` binding

### 2. Call Stack
- LIFO (Last In First Out) principle
- Function execution tracking
- Stack overflow
- Recursion and call stack
- Synchronous nature

### 3. Memory Heap
- Heap vs Stack memory
- Object storage and references
- Memory allocation process
- Heap size management
- Memory leaks

### 4. Hoisting
- Variable hoisting (`var`)
- Function declaration hoisting
- Temporal Dead Zone (`let`/`const`)
- Function expression vs declaration
- Hoisting order and priority

### 5. Scope & Lexical Environment
- Global, Function, Block, and Module scope
- Lexical scoping
- Scope chain resolution
- Variable shadowing
- `var` vs `let` vs `const` scope differences

### 6. Closures (Deep)
- Closure definition and mechanism
- State preservation
- Data privacy patterns
- Module pattern
- Function factories
- Memory considerations

### 7. Garbage Collection
- Mark and Sweep algorithm
- Generational garbage collection
- Reachability concept
- Memory leak causes and prevention
- V8 engine GC strategies

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this day, you should understand:
- How JavaScript executes code internally
- How memory is managed in JavaScript
- How scope and closures work
- How to avoid common memory leaks
- How to debug scope and hoisting issues

## 📖 Study Approach

1. **Read each topic** in the given order
2. **Understand the theory** (both Hinglish and English)
3. **Practice the code examples** in each topic
4. **Complete the mini practice tasks**
5. **Review interview Q&A** sections
6. **Understand common mistakes** to avoid

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Each topic builds on previous concepts
- Don't skip any section - follow the complete structure
- Practice code examples hands-on
- Focus on understanding "why" not just "what"
- Review common mistakes to avoid pitfalls
