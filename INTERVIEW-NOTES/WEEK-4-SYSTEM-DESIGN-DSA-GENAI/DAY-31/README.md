# WEEK 4 - DAY 31: Graphs (Representation, BFS, DFS)

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 1. Graph Representation
- Adjacency List
- Adjacency Matrix
- Edge List
- Weighted and unweighted graphs
- Directed and undirected graphs
- Comparison of representations

### 2. BFS & DFS
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Recursive and iterative implementations
- Shortest path (BFS)
- Cycle detection
- Connected components
- Topological sort
- Common graph problems

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this day, you should understand:
